# hardlyworking.biz

An simple narrative website displaying excerpts from Studs Terkel's book *Working: People Talk About What They Do All Day and How They Feel About What They Do*. The website juxtaposes the narrative portraits Terkel compiled with stock office photography. The comic book frame adds a layer of detachment and entertainment to the project questioning the form of work today.
Technically, this site is a no-frills HTML site.
